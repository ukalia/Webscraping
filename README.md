This repository contains project for which the data has been gathered from different websites using Webscraping . 
Projects :
1. NBA 2020-2021 MVP Frontrunners : 
In this project , I have taken the player data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ . The data includes the basic stats such as points per game , rebounds per game , steals per game, assists per game ,blocks per game etc and also some advanced stats such as usage percentage and win share. Weightage has been assigned to each stat and then a total value has been calculated which is then used to find the top 10 players in the league.
